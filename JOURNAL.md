- **! Reminder !**: `Head` instances must be 'clipped' to relevant `Section` (in order to resize parent section (responsive) or remove preceding section without having `Head` instances jumping or sliding through current section, (global position should be as meaningless as possible))

- What about `Division` for renaming as well `Space` as `Section` ?

- Should root Space automatically be seen as expandable (ExpandEnum.EXPAND)?  
...in order to allow simpler timeline agregation later.

### Space: changed children disposition  
Introducing `ExpandEnum(FIXED, EXPAND)`.  
Now, inside a `Space(expand===ExpandEnum.EXPAND)` children can be stacked (as div in a page).  
This implies that parent Space can now **inherit size** from children.  
Such parent cannot be referent to children relative dimensions. So to compute relative dimensions, `resolveSpace()` now searches for a fixed parent via `getFixedParent`.
